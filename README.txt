	              Spotify Discover Weekly Automation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: 
	    Have you ever gave the Discover weekly playlist on spotify a listen? 
	    Have you ever listened to a song you really liked from that playlist 
	    but you forgot to save it for later?

	    This is the problem I also faced so I decided to fix my problem 
            using my Python knowledge.

	    I decided to use Spotify's very own Web API which can be found
	    here (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

	    	                 Program functionality
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
            This program will go into Spoifiy's Discover Weekly playlist, pull 
            all the songs and will automatically create a new playlist with 
            those songs of that week. 
 
            Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist changes every week so this 
            program will run every Monday and it will create a new playlist with the songs of that week and will have the date 
            the playlist was created as the title.
